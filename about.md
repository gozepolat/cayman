Who am I? I am a machine learning engineer currently working in Berlin, and very busy with procrastinating the writing part of my PhD 
dissertation on deep learning. At work, I've been enjoying shrinking up object detection models into a tiny size for embedded systems 
lately, but my main "spare-time hobby" is creating bioinspired deep architectures.

Speaking of weird hobbies, if you are wondering how I created my profile picture, feel free to check it out [here](/perona_malik_on_drugs)!. I have some normal hobbies such as chess, piano, sci-fi & fantasy books, poetry and drawing.

Who am I? Well, if you really want a longer answer, here is a philosophical one that will basically say either nothing or everything about me: 

"Who" is but a function of "what", and I have a strong suspicion that what I am is not very different than what you are, dear curious reader. (Are you also procrastinating?)

Yunus Emre says "I am the drop that contains the ocean". 

Who am I? It may be the case that the universe is governed by a handful of rules. A limited set of rules may apply in various scales over and over again. There is a branch called "quantum cosmology" in the theoretical physics. Quantum cosmologists believe that the predictions of quantum theory after the big bang can be observed in the largest scale: the entirety of the universe. It appears, the universe and its smallest components have some similarities. Perhaps, what the researchers observe is indeed an early quantum state blown to the size of the universe. Was this "inflation", this massive scale up of the universe a coincidence? What if it was inevitable, what if it was entailed from these handful of rules? What if the universe itself is a fractal, a self repeating structure where the same rules apply over and over again?

Who am I? I am not sure how much of _the ocean_ I contain but I do love creating pretty fractal gifs. I came up with this one using the below recurrence relation:
